This is a google-homepage clone made as an assignment on The Odin Project(a web developer course).
First of all for this project I installed GIT and learned how to use it on a basic level using commands such as git clone,git init, git add, git commit -m, git log,git show, git push and more.

This project contains a HTML page and a CSS page.

-how to add images to a webpage using img tag
-how to add links to a webpage using the a tag
-how to divide my webpage into sections using tags such as divs, footer, nav, main

In CSS a learned:
-how to use flexbox layout model using properties such as display, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, gap;
-how to position elements in the page using properties such as position and top.
-how to style elements using properties such as width, height, background-color, border, border-radius, padding, text-decoration.
